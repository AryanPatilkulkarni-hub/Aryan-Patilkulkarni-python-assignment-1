3.	You’re building a small program for a school. The user must enter the student’s name and marks in three subjects. The program should calculate the total, average, and display a grade. If marks are not between 0 and 100, show an error message. 
Concepts: Input/Output, data validation, arithmetic, if–elif–else.
